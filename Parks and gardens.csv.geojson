A short walk around the Nature Trail - devised and maintained by a group of local residents - reveals a surprising variety of habitats. The park has been awarded a Green Flag since 2009, in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","History and heritage":"The name Craiglockhart probably comes from either the Lockhart family, who owned the land in the 14th century, or is from the gaelic description of the area- Craig-Loch-ard (rocky hill by a loch).\r\nIn 1773 the estate was sold to the Munro family. Alex Munro planted trees on Easter Craiglockhart and allowed residents to walk there. In 1917, the war poets, Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Own were treated at the Craiglockhart Hydropath, built in 1880 (now Edinburgh Napier University Craiglockhart Campus). ","Wildlife":"Beside the Craiglockhart Sports Centre lies a large ornamental pond, dating from 1878, which drains into a carefully managed marsh - an unusual habitat in a city.  This marsh is home to orchids, provides a hunting ground for herons and is a safe haven for smaller waterfowl to raise their broods. The slopes of the hill are clad in semi-natural woodland, that is, woodland planted at least 200 years ago which is so well-established that it has been colonised by plants, birds and animals of ancient woodland.  A large meadow at the top of the Hill is another rare habitat for a city - unimproved grassland, home to small mammals and wild flowers.","Geology":"Old red sandstone formed 400 million years ago under a shallow sea, then 325 million years ago, volcanoes erupted. When they cooled they formed the hard igneous rock which is Easter Craiglockhart Hill. You can see this rock as lava outcrops. The softer, green coloured rock on the edge of the hill is volcanic tuff, which is volcanic ash expelled when the volcano erupted.  Later, earthquakes caused the rock to split leaving steep sided cliffs. 12,000 years ago a huge sheet of ice covered the area. When it melted, the valleys were cut leaving the hills you see today.","Visitor information":"Reached by Lothian Bus numbers 24,27 or 29.","Public Toilets":null,"Book sports facilities":null,"Organise an event":"<a href=\"http://eventsedinburgh.org.uk/Parks-Greenspace.html\">Find out how to organise an event in Edinburgh's parks</a>","Getting involved":"<a href=\"http://www.craiglockhartwoods.org\">Craiglockhart Woods website</a>","Other useful links":"<a href=\"http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20064/parks_and_green_spaces/270/natural_heritage_sites\">Natural Heritage Service</a>","Green Flag":"Since 2009","Management Plan":"<a href=\"http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/899/easter_craiglockhart_hill_local_nature_reserve_management_plan\">Easter Craiglockhart Management Plan</a>","Why don't you?":"Look at the levels of woodland- each level is home to insects, birds and mammals.","Location map":"55.923431638952884,-3.233156204223633"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-3.2434558868408203","55.962750084889855"]},"properties":{"Image":null,"Name":"Easter Drylaw Park","Address":"Easter Drylaw Drive","Postcode":"EH4 2RT","Telephone":"0131 529 5050","Email":"sfc.northneighbourhood@edinburgh.gov.uk","Opening hours":null,"Facilities":"Play area\r\nMountain bike track\r\nSeating","Background":"A small community park located on the north Edinburgh cyclepath.

Other attractions include the Ice House, the Doocot within the walled garden and a pump system along the burn which was used to provide running water to the House. The reserve has held a Green Flag since 2011 in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","History and heritage":"The area is steeped in history - some of which is told in the old Hermitage House where the Headquarter of the City of Edinburgh Countryside Natural Heritage Service provides a charming Visitor Centre full of displays, activities and information. You can also explore the surroundings to discover the Ice House, the Doocot in the Walled Garden and even a clever water pump system along the burn that provided running water to the Hermitage House in the past!\r\nThe first recorded owner of this area was the son of a Belgian knight called De Brad, in the 12th Century. His son, Henri De Brad, was Sheriff of Edinburgh. He and his guests hunted for deer and wild boar in the forest.\r\nIn 1775 the architect Robert Burn was employed by Charles Gordon of Cluny to design the mansion house. The house was finished in 1788 and it was around this time that the dovecot, walled garden, stables and ice house were built. The dovecot housed pigeons which were eaten by the householders. The ice house was used to store food. It was kept cold by filling the base with ice colleted from local ponds and wrapped in straw, so it melted more slowly.\r\nIn 1937, the Hermitage was presented to the city as a public park by the owner John McDougal.","Wildlife":"There is a wonderful mixture of habitats including woodland, scrubland, grassland, the Braid Burn and wetland which all provide a refuge for wildlife.  Listen for green woodpecker calling from the top of the tall beech trees and if you are lucky, you could startle a fox hunting rabbits or even an otter swimming in the burn! Don't forget your binoculars as you might be surprised by the amazing birdlife you will encounter; herons, kestrels, kingfishers, song thrush and even tawny owls can be regularly seen around the Nature Reserve! A visit to Blackford Pond will give you a chance to get close to swans, mallards, geese, coots and more depending on the time of year. The Hermitage of Braid is a designated ancient woodland. This means that woodland has covered the site for at least 300 years. However, much of the woodland is now semi-natural with beech (Fagus sylvatica), Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and Sycamore (Acer pseudplatanus) regenerating freely. Most of the large, mature tees probably date from the early 19th century and there are many very old and large specimens scattered throughout the attractive woodland setting. Many exceed 40m in height, especially those growing in the valley bottom, which could make them the tallest trees in Edinburgh.","Geology":"Blackford Hill is a contrast to the deep gorge of the Hermitage Wood. The Hill was formed from the oldest rock in Edinburgh and offers impressive panoramic views of the city, the Pentland Hills and Firth of Forth. Enthusiastic geologists love this place as it is full of significant hotspots to study rock formation. In 1840 the Swiss geologist Louis Agassiz declared the grooves in the rocks of Blackford Quarry were caused by glaciers and this was the start of a whole new chapter of geological study in Scotland .","Visitor information":null,"Public Toilets":"Public toilets are located at the stables.\r\nOpening times: Monday to Friday, 9am-4pm.","Book sports facilities":null,"Organise an event":"<a href=\"http://eventsedinburgh.org.uk/Parks-Greenspace.html\">Find out how to organise an event in Edinburgh's parks</a>","Getting involved":"<a href=\"http://www.fohb.org/new/index.htm\">Friends of the Park</a>","Other useful links":null,"Green Flag":"Yes, since 2011","Management Plan":"<a href=\"http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/903/hermitage_of_braid_local_nature_reserve_management_plan\">Hermitage of Braid Management Plan","Why don't you?":null,"Location map":"55.919584171128385,-3.2010555267333984"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-3.177967071533203","55.957945570368686"]},"properties":{"Image":null,"Name":"Hillside Cresent Gardens","Address":"Hillside Crescent","Postcode":"EH7 5EA","Telephone":"0131 529 7061","Email":"sfc.centralneighbourhood@edinburgh.gov.uk","Opening hours":null,"Facilities":"Seating\r\nWoodland\r\nGrassed areas","Background":"Hillside Crescent Gardens were created by William Playfair to enrich the New Town crescent.

The 5 acre site was designed to reflect the new discoveries and knowledge of Botany at that time. By 1820, when Robert Graham became the 3rd Regius Keeper, the Garden site established by John Hope could no longer accommodate its collections properly, so the decision was made to move it to a new site in Inverleith where the current Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh is now found.  \r\nThe old site was built on as Edinburgh expanded and the small area of garden left became a neglected site - full of rubbish. In the 1990s the local community started to get involved with the site and in 2002 the Friends of Hopetoun Crescent Garden were established. They breathed fresh life into the park by clearing the rubbish, upgrading paths and installing interpretation panels.","Wildlife":"The Garden was always planned as a natural wildlife park and to this end many thousands of wild flowers, wild grasses and spring bulbs have been planted by local children and the Friends group.

Sculpted by glaciers and water, then shaped by people over thousands of years, the Pentland Hills are a special place for everyone. With around 10,000 hectares of countryside and over 100 km of waymarked paths, the Regional Park is a great place for walking, cycling, horse riding, fishing and orienteering. The Regional Park offers both gentle and challenging routes, taking you to summits, through cleughs and glens as well as around reservoirs. Vistas from the higher tops give a panoramic view across the Firth of Forth, the Borders and to Ben Lomond. The Park has two visitor centres, Harlaw House Visitor Centre and Flotterstone Information Centre that provide information, advice and displays on what to do and see in the Regional Park. Located adjacent to Harlaw House Visitor Centre is Harlaw Wildlife Garden, a lovely sun trap ideal for picnics. It holds a Green Flag in recognition of it being a quality greenspace.","History and heritage":"The Pentland Hills Regional Park was designated in 1986. Majority of the land is in private ownership, with the City of Edinburgh Council, Midlothian Council and West Lothian Council all having statutory duties to their constituent parts of the Park. The City of Edinburgh Council is the leading authority of the Regional Park, with the City of Edinburgh Council Natural Heritage Service providing the Park services.\r\nThe Regional Park has four aims that the three local authorities agreed to adhere to: 1.To retain the essential character of the hills as a place for the peaceful enjoyment of the countryside; 2. Caring for the hills so that the landscape and the habitat is protected and enhanced; 3. Within this caring framework to encourage responsible public enjoyment of the hills; 4. co-ordination of these aims so that they co-exist with farming and other land uses within the Pentland Hills Regional Park.\r\nThe Park is rich with heritage; from archaeological sites including 12 scheduled ancient monuments, such as, hill forts and cairns, to geological sites that are 430 million years old including three Geodiversity sites. The Pentlands are also steeped in history, with the Battle of Rullion green taking place in 1666 as well as being the hunting ground for Sir Robert the Bruce.","Wildlife":"The Park contains a variety of important habitats: heather moorland, woodland, open grassland and reservoirs. This rich mosaic of wildlife, open spaces, farmed land and natural beauty is a result of people having been part of the landscape for thousands of years. Working closely with farmers, landowners and communities, the Pentland Hills Regional Park seeks to retain the essential character of the hills. For bird watchers the Park is abundant with both resident and migrating species. The Park has three enclosed bird hides where hours can be spent watching the wildfowl. The Natural Heritage Service offers the opportunity for the public to help survey some of the rarer species in the Regional Park.

They are listed structures which used to stand in the garden of Argyle House, Hope Lane. The pillars were restored by Graciela Ainsworth and her team of stone conservators. New crown tops for two of the pillars were skilfully made by local potter Alison Robinson.

The later purchase of 5.86 acres was from part of the estate of Damhead from Sir Archibald Campbell of Succoth in 1906.

The majority of the area came into Council ownership in 1900 when it was purchased from Sir William Baird Tuke. At that time, a nine-hole golf course, nursery and playing fields were laid out.  In 1908, Saughton became the site of the great Scottish National Exhibition, opened by HRH Prince Arthur of Connaught. During the Second World War, the formal gardens were turned into onion beds as Saughton helped dig for victory. After WWII, Saughtonhall mansion house, which had earlier been turned into an asylum for the mentally ill, was destroyed in a controlled burning by the fire bigrade, as it had become riddled with dry rot. In 1984 the Winter Garden was formally opened by Lord Provost John McKay. Most recently, an award winning skateboard park was constructed in 2010 and a brand new play area was opened in 2012. There is currently a project underway to restore and improve the park.
